# PG_quantum_entanglement
Postgraduate dissertation in quantum entanglement using shadows and a neural network

In the main folder, there are 2 files (so far):

 - The first one is called Entanglement_classical which uses numpy to classically compute the entanglement (Von Nuemann and Schmidt Gap)
 - The second is called Entanglement_shadows which uses shadows from pennylane to compute entanglement.
